**P1**: Understanding Compiler in a Linux Environment and Decrypting Texts Using the Caesar Cipher Technique**
Explored the operation of a compiler in a Linux environment and practiced decrypting texts using the Caesar cipher technique.

**P2A**: Pointer Understanding in C and Creating Checkerboards
Utilized pointers in C to create checkerboards with varying sizes.

**P2B**: Automatically Generating Magic Squares with Pointers
Implemented an automatic generation of magic squares using pointers.

**P3**: Understanding Heap Memory Operations and Dynamic Memory Allocation
Gained insights into how heap memory functions and created a heap block to demonstrate memory allocation, freeing, and delayed coalescing.

**P4A**: Analyzing Cache Memory Allocation
Analyzed cache memory allocation, focusing on how data is stored in cache memory and its implications on system performance.

**P4B**: Constructing Cache Memory with Initialization, Access, and Eviction
Constructed a cache memory system, including initialization, data access (cache hits and misses), and eviction procedures.

**P5**: Reading Assembly Language and Translating to C
Practiced reading assembly language code and translating it into C, aiding in the understanding of low-level system operations.

**P6**: Understanding Signal Handling in C and Testing in Linux Shells
Developed a signal handler in C, enabling the implementation of signal sending and receiving. Tested the signal handler in Linux shells to explore inter-process communication using signals.
